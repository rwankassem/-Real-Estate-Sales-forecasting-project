#  Real-Estate-Sales-forecasting-project

##  Project Name: 
**Sales Forecasting and Price Prediction**

## Team Members:
- Rwan Taha (Team Leader)
- Asmaa Gamal
- Sara Ashraf
- Mohamed Abdelhamid

---

This project predicts house prices using machine learning models like **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Linear Regression**, based on real estate data.

It also includes a fully interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for data exploration and visualization.

---

##  Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (House Age, House Size, City Frequency)
- Outlier Detection & Handling
- Correlation Analysis & EDA
- ML Modeling (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Streamlit App for Visualization & Filtering

## Visual Examples

### Categorical Feature Association (Cramér's V)  
- Shows correlation between categorical features.  
---

### PCA Projection  
- Dimensionality reduction to visualize house clusters based on price.  
---

### ANOVA Feature Importance  
- Which categorical features have the most impact on price.  
---

### Model Comparison  
- Evaluation of models using R², MAE, MSE.  
---

### Streamlit App Interface  
- Filter data based on user selections and visualize results in real-time.
---

### Deployment Architecture  
- How the ML model was integrated into Django backend and served through Streamlit.
